## 🎯 Objective:
Simulate basic traffic filtering using the built-in macOS Firewall by blocking and allowing specific applications and services.

## 💻 System Used:

- System Settings > Firewall

## 🛠 Steps Performed:
1. Enabled the Firewall from Network settings
2. Blocked incoming traffic for a chosen app (simulate port 23 block)
3. Allowed incoming traffic for Remote Login (SSH – port 22)
4. Restored original firewall state

## 🧠 Learnings:
- macOS firewall manages **inbound traffic**
- GUI offers simple rules per app, not raw port numbers
- Useful for understanding firewall concepts without terminal commands
